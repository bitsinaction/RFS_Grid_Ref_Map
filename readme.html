Plot a 6 digit grid reference on a map.  <br/>  
<br/>
A RFS 6 digit grid reference, is a shorthand, fast and simplified mwy of communicating locations within a operations area.<br/>
<br/>
This simplification involves removing redundant (to local operations) data, such as uneccessary accuracy, and the broader location.<br/>
<br/>
As such the operations area that the grid reference applies to is not know, just from the 6 digit ref. So this map just plots all possibilities (for each blue grid), and you must work out which grid they are likely talking about from the location of the reporter.<br/>
<br/>
To get a 6 digit reference, RFS start with a full UTM grid reference off a map and:<br/>
For the Easting, take the 2nd,3rd & 4th digits, and for the Northing take the 3rd, 4th & 5th digit.<br/>
