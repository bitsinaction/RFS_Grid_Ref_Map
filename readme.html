Plot a 6 digit grid reference on a map.  <br/>  
<br/>
An RFS 6 digit grid reference, is a fast and simplified way of communicating locations within a known operations area of 100kmx100km.<br/>
<br/>
This simplification involves removing the unnecessary details (to the local operation) of accuracy and the broader location.<br/>
<br/>
When mapping a 6 digit grid reference the specific 100x100km area it applies to is not know from just the 6 digits. Therefore we map all possibilities (for each blue grid), and you must work out which one is the most likely due to the location the report came from.<br/>
<br/>
One way to get a 6 digit reference: start with a full UTM grid reference off a map and: For the Easting, take the 2nd,3rd & 4th digits, and for the Northing take the 3rd, 4th & 5th digits.<br/>
